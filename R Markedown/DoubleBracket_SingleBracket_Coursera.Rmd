Difference between single bracket [] and double bracket [[]] operation
Subsetting Lists
```{r}
x<-list(foo=1:4,bar=0.6)
x[1]
x[[1]]
```
As you can see, the single bracket only return the same class as its operate target.
Whereas, the double brackets will just return stuff inside the first element.
```{r}
x$bar
x[["bar"]]
x["bar"]
```
Upper process shows you the differences including $ sign in it.

```{r}
x<-list(a=list(10,12,14),b=c(3.14,2.5))
x[[c(1,3)]]
x[[1]][[3]]
x[[c(2,1)]]
```

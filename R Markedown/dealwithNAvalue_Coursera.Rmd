```{r}
x<-c(1,2,NA,4,NA,5)
bad<-is.na(x)
x[!bad]
x[bad]
```
bad vector is a logical vector
What if you have multiple vectors need to be judged
```{r}
y<-c("a","b",NA,"d",NA,"f")
good<-complete.cases(x,y)
good
x[good]
y[good]
```

complete.cased() can also be applied to data frame, just get the subset of null NA rows of the data

Reading in Larger DAtasets with read.table
How to tab all the columns of your large dataset?

```{r}
initial<-read.table("/Users/xingewang/Desktop/Lab2/SeattleSeqAnnotation138.SRR2968056_chr22.vcf",skip = 2,nrows = 100)
classes<-sapply(initial,class)
classes
tabAll<-read.table("/Users/xingewang/Desktop/Lab2/SeattleSeqAnnotation138.SRR2968056_chr22.vcf",colClasses = classes)
lapply(tabAll, class)
```

Set nrows doesn't make R run faster but it helps with memory usage. A mild overestimate is okay. You can also use the Unix tool wc to calculate the number of lines in a file.
